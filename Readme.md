```
npm install -g serverless
Pro tip: You can install the NPM module local to your project, instead of globally.

$ npm install serverless --save-dev
The Serverless team likes to move fast and break things, so it might be a good idea to set your Serverless version in your package.json. This way, you can use the latest version of Serverless on new projects without impacting older ones.

The tradeoff is that youâ€™ll have to drill down to a subfolder in order to reach the serverless executable:

 ./node_modules/serverless/bin/serverless

serverless create --template aws-nodejs

```
